# RISC-V Toolchain

Welcome to the RISC-V Toolchain project!

This repository contains the source code for the RISC-V Toolchain
project, a fork of the LLVM project containing build scripts and
auxiliary material for building LLVM based toolchains targeting
RISC-V for bare-metal environments.

## Goal

This project aims to provide an LLVM based platform containing
the necessary libraries and tools for building C and C++ toolchains
for bare-metal: [RISC-V Toolchain for Embedded](https://github.com/Laur59/RTfE/blob/riscv-software/riscv-software/embedded/README.md)
